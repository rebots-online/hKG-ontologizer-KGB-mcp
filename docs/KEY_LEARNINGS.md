This document captures critical learnings from the development and troubleshooting of the Knowledge Graph Builder MCP project, designed to benefit future projects and prevent rediscovering the same solutions.

## üîÑ AsyncIO Event Loop Management in UI Applications

### Problem
**Error**: `"asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop"`

**Context**: Gradio applications with async backend functions

### Root Cause
- Gradio runs in its own event loop
- `asyncio.run()` creates a new event loop and cannot be called from within an existing one
- Mixing sync UI callbacks with async backend functions creates conflict

### Solution Pattern
```python
def sync_wrapper_for_gradio(input_data):
    """Robust pattern for Gradio async integration"""
    import asyncio
    import concurrent.futures
    
    try:
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        if loop.is_running():
            # Use thread pool for isolation
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
                future = executor.submit(
                    lambda: asyncio.run(async_function(input_data))
                )
                return future.result()
        else:
            return loop.run_until_complete(async_function(input_data))
    except RuntimeError:
        return asyncio.run(async_function(input_data))
```

### Key Principles
1. **Never use `asyncio.run()` inside async functions** - use `await` instead
2. **Detect event loop state** before creating new loops
3. **Use ThreadPoolExecutor** for sync/async boundary isolation
4. **Test in target environment** - behavior differs between standalone and framework contexts

### Cross-Project Value
- **High** - Affects any Python application mixing async/await with UI frameworks
- **Technologies**: Gradio, Streamlit, FastAPI + UI, Jupyter, MCP servers
- **Pattern**: Reusable wrapper pattern for similar integrations

## üèóÔ∏è hKG (Hybrid Knowledge Graph) Architecture Insights

### UUIDv8 for Cross-System Entity Tracking
- **Purpose**: Unified entity identification across Neo4j, Qdrant, and PostgreSQL
- **Implementation**: Timestamp-based UUIDv8 generation with namespace encoding
- **Benefit**: Enables cross-database correlation and lineage tracking

### Real-Time Visualization with Incremental Updates
- **Pattern**: Progressive graph building with SVG generation at each chunk
- **Files**: Incremental SVG saves for large content processing
- **Storage**: Visualization metadata tracked in both Neo4j and Qdrant

### Chunked Processing for Large Content
- **Threshold**: 2000 character chunks with 200 character overlap
- **Benefits**: Handles 300MB+ content, real-time progress, memory efficiency
- **Challenge**: Maintaining entity consistency across chunks

## üîß Development Process Learnings

### MCP Integration Strategy
- **Local Development**: Mock MCP responses for rapid iteration
- **Production**: Full MCP server integration with Claude Code environment
- **Testing**: Dual-mode operation (standalone + MCP-enabled)

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Application functions even without optional components
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed progress tracking for debugging
- **User Communication**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: All external service URLs and keys
- **Provider Flexibility**: Support for Ollama, LM Studio, and hosted APIs
- **Model Discovery**: Dynamic model listing from active providers

## üìä Performance and Scalability Insights

### Memory Management
- **Streaming Processing**: Chunk-based handling prevents memory overflow
- **SVG Generation**: Temporary file cleanup to prevent disk bloat
- **Vector Storage**: Embedding generation with fallback strategies

### Concurrency Patterns
- **Async/Await**: Native async for I/O-bound operations
- **Thread Pools**: Isolation for event loop conflicts
- **Progress Callbacks**: Real-time updates without blocking

## üéØ Prevention Guidelines for Future Projects

### AsyncIO Integration
1. Design clear sync/async boundaries from project start
2. Use event loop detection in all wrapper functions
3. Test with both standalone and framework execution
4. Document async/sync interfaces clearly

### Knowledge Graph Projects
1. Plan for large content from the beginning
2. Implement incremental processing early
3. Design for multiple storage backends
4. Include visualization in the core architecture

### MCP Server Development
1. Build with dual-mode operation (local + MCP)
2. Mock external services for development
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Plan for various deployment environments
